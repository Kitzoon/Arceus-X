# Arceus X Source Code
Arceus X's APK decompiled with apk-decompiler, which is based on Apktool.

# Links
Decompiler Used: https://github.com/shaybc/apk-decompiler (shoutout to shaybc on github for working on the decompiler, his project is small so go and give him some love)

Apktool (apk-decompiler is based on Apktool and uses it for decompiling): https://bitbucket.org/iBotPeaches/apktool/downloads/

# Note
This decompiled source code was NOT looked at and is not confirmed to be the full code of Arceus X, I have 0 knowledge of android development and am not interested in attempting to confirm this to be the entire code.

And once again github isn't letting me upload the full sized source, so zip files we go again! You can download the mentioned zip file in the releases tab.
